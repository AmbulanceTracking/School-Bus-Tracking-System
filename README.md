An increased concern amongst parents today is the safety of their children on the way to school and back home. School Bus Tracking System helps the parents to keep track of school bus in which their child is travelling. Schools today are increasingly using GPS enabled school bus tracking system, ensuring student safety during transit. Continuous tracking and positioning of the school vehicle is easy with GPS enabled buses.
We are proposing a system where the parents, along with the school administrators can track the school bus at any time. This real-time school bus tracking system is using the Global Positioning System (GPS) technology to receive the live location of the school bus which is being called.
School Bus Tracking System is an android application used to Track School Bus. This an application used by parents to track the bus of their child. This application keeps parents free from tension. They can track the current position of their childâ€™s bus. Parents enter the application using username and password. Before login they need to register themselves.
The School Admin has authority to add parent and add Driver. For school management also this application is useful to track the bus. In case of any emergency they can easily get the location of the bus.
Driver uses login and password to enter the application. As soon as he Turn on his GPS the location will be fetched and displayed to admin and parent.
It is mandatory for Parents, School Admin and Drivers to have Android Phone. The application will track the bus by tracking the GPS Location of bus.
So, this application is useful for all parents for safety of their child.
